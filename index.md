# Dave Patel's First CS193 Homework 

- We get to learn 2 of the most utilized tools in CS (Git/Github and Linux)
- Seems like a class where we can learn as much more as we want about the tools. (Ex, I coule create my own bash script to automate moving all of the pictures on my computer to a different file or flash drive.
- The instructors seem pretty cool and funny!
